== Description ==
This will be my first plugin to give it to the community.
Approximately One hour a ago i need an build-in DiskFreeSpace-showing ..thing and *taadaa* there is it.
The plugin shows the disk-space at your server on your wp-backand inside of the tools-sidebar.

This first plugin is usefull if you have small servers and you have to have an eye on your disk usage.
 
== Installation ==
No further briefing is needed.
Just copy the plugin into your plugins-directory,
got to plugins-configuration-page, check if your system will not be slow down by the plugin and than activate it
Now you can see in the "Admin-Tools"-sidebar how many of kilobytes or terrabytes are used on your server.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
For much bigger sites, where use of this plugin can have dramatically effect, i will build an other version* 
with an static button to request an single diskusage-measurement and buffer this one. 
(*) only if anyone ask for/need it
